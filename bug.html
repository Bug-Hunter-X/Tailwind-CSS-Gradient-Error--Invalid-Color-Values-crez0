<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes. However, if the `from-` or `to-` color values are not valid Tailwind CSS colors, it will result in unexpected rendering, or no gradient at all.  The issue isn't directly a Tailwind bug, but rather an error in using its classes correctly.  Ensure you're using valid Tailwind color names or hex codes.
